# Philosophy

## Minimal specification

The user should have to use the smallest number of key-strokes to specify their
intent.

## No black magic

All generated code that wires things together should be visible in plain sight
and as minimal as possible.

There aren't any `Noun & And` specific code in the generated code.

## Customization

Every possible customization provided by the underlying libraries, should be
made available to the user. Where possible, `Noun & Verb` will generate the
appropriate boiler-plate code, making it a fill-in-the-blanks exercise.
