# Troubleshooting

## Initialization Error

- `PrismaClientInitializationError: Invalid "prisma.[model].[operation]()" invocation`

It because your `Prisma` schema is not synchronized with database schema.

Try running `npx prisma db push` or `npx prisma migrate dev`before running
`npx prisma db seed`.

## Request Timed Out

- `PrismaClientKnownRequestError:  Invalid "prisma.[model].[operation]()" invocation`
- `Timed out fetching a new connection from the connection pool.`

It's because there're too many connections being opened to the database.

Try changing `concurrency` value in `src/__tests__/fixtures/seeder/index.ts`.
Note that the change you made in `index.ts` will be overwritten when generator
is runned again.
